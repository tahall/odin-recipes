A simple recipe website

In fact, it is a very simple, basic recipe website developed as an exercise
as part of the Odin Project.

It servces as a review of the following:

- git and GitHub
- HTML main (index.html) page sections, tags and boilerplate
- links
- headers, paragraphs, <strong> and <em>
- images
